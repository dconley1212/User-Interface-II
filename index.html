        <div class="introduction">
        <p>Why did I want to become a Web Developer? Well, there are a lot of reasons I chose to learn coding, but it started with a desire to learn a hard skill that could better my family's life and provide great value to a company. After learning a little, I realized I liked the challenge of it and it was a lot more fun than I expected. Coming from a career in sales I liked the challenge of sales, but wanted a little more out of my life.</p>
